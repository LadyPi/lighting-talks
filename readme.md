#Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create a 10 minute presentation on a topic that is useful to your fellow developers.  It should address the following:

- What problem does this technology solve?

I chose Amazon EC2.
Amazon EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Computing.
This service allows you to rent storage and purchase instances based on your company needs. Instead of worrying about a server room and building out an environment physically to have machines for your company, Amazon has created this resource for you with an applicaiton to manage and scale as much as you need.

- How do you use it? Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?

You can get started here:

- What did you build? (demo)
Based on the videos, I created an instance.
